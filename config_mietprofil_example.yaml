# ===== MIETPROFIL (TENANT PROFILE) HANDLING =====
#
# The Mietprofil checkbox is ALWAYS verified and checked before form submission.
# This happens automatically for email forms (company listings).
#
# How it works:
# - Right before clicking "Submit", the bot checks if the Mietprofil checkbox is checked
# - If it's NOT checked, the bot will click the label to check it
# - If it's already checked, the bot does nothing (to avoid unchecking it)
# - If the state can't be determined, the bot skips interaction (safer)
#
# This approach is:
# - Simple: One state check method (JavaScript checked property)
# - Reliable: Check happens right before submission (nothing can uncheck it after)
# - Human-like: Smooth scroll into view, then click the label element
# - Safe: Only clicks if we can confirm it's currently unchecked
#
# No configuration needed - this behavior is built-in and always active.
